this walks through the strategy that maximizes score per row. assumptions: that it is reds turn and the board has just
been created, so only the cells in the first and last columns have pawns (1 each).

1. this strategy loops through every card in red's hand.
2. for every card, it loops through each row and checks the score. if red is winning the row (has more points), it will
   skip that row
    3. in the first row, index 0, red is not winning (it is tied), so the strategy jumps into that row.
4. for that row, the strategy makes sure that adding the value of the current card (3) will make red win that row.
   it will in this case.
5. it then goes through every cell in that row, checking to see if the cell can hold the current card.
   6. the first cell in this row has 1 pawn, and the current card has a cost of 1.
7. it determines that place the current card in this cell WILL make red win that row, so it tells the controller to
   do so.
