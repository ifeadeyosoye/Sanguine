this describes how the strategy picks the first available move:

1. for every card in the current player's hand (red in this case) it goes through the rows, top down, looking for where
   it can be placed
2. in the first row it checks column 1, the first cell.
3. it sees that there is one pawn there. this works perfectly becuase the card it has currently has a cost of 1.
4. without any other restrictions, it returns the coordinates of the cell as well as the card to the controller.
